# LibraryManagement
The project titled Library Management System is Library management software for monitoring and controlling the transactions in a library. The project is developed in java (Swings) and SQL, which mainly focuses on the basic operations in a library like adding new student, new books, and updating existing information, searching books and members and facility to borrow and return books designed to help users maintain and organize library. It features a familiar and well thought-out, an attractive user interface, combined with strong searching Insertion and report generation facility. 
Using this system user can issue book to the library members , maintain their records, and can checks how many books are issued and how many books are available in the library. Librarian can  modify the database whenever need be. Users can search for books and renew the books .
In the proposed system, we assume that each member as well as each different book will be having a unique identity. Whenever a library member wishes to take a book, the book issued by the library authority will check and update both the book details as well as the student details in library database while issuing.
